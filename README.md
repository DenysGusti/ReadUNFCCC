Reading data from the Excel CRF tables submitted by countries to the UNFCCC and extracting the data to new Excel files containing the whole time series, a file for one country with worksheets for every CRF table in selected UNFCCC sector. Currently, the script handles the LULUCF sector (Table4 family) and some tables of the Agriculture sector. The script can be extended to read all sectors.
In 2024, the main branch was adapted for the new CRT format. The previous CRF format was moved to the Old-CRF-format branch.
